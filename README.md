# witch-craft_handheld
An x86-based hand-held gaming device.

This project came about since I felt that the majority of x86-based hand-helds on the market all
have significant bulk, that makes them somewhat unwieldy for certain users.

Enter then, this project, where a sleaker, smaller device is created, with a fully open system-architecture, that allows the end-users to more easily service, upgrade and even utilize their device.

All of the physical and electrical schematics will be available in this repository, in order to realize this goal of open-ness.
